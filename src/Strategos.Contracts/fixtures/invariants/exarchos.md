    summary: >
      The append-only event log is the source of truth. Every read-model is a
      left-fold over events; state mutations are events, not in-place updates.
      Reducers must be pure, deterministic, and structurally share state. Stores
      that hold derived state across calls must be projections over events,
      never in-memory side databases.

    summary: >
      Concurrency is serialized in two tiers. This is a CLOSED claim, not a
      target (DR-19 / EFF-001, closed 2026-08-04). Tier 1 (in-process): the
      StreamLockManager runs concurrent same-stream appends sequentially via a
      per-stream Promise-chain mutex. Tier 2 (cross-process): SQLite WAL with
      BEGIN IMMEDIATE acquires the write lock up-front, and a per-stream version
      gate assigns-and-checks the sequence atomically INSIDE that transaction
      (the convergent event-store primitive — Marten mt_streams, SQLStreamStore,
      EventStoreDB). The PRIMARY KEY (streamId, sequence) is an integrity
      backstop, not the conflict detector. Plain appends serialize
      transparently; only a genuine OCC mismatch (a stale expectedSequence)
      surfaces a conflict, carrying expected/actual directly. No process-level
      mutex, no PID lock, no advisory file. WITNESS: three genuine OS child
      processes drive the production SqliteBackend through the production driver
      against one SQLite file, held in the write-lock queue simultaneously and
      asserting an interleaving witness (a run that did not actually contend
      fails), plus a startup version-gate repair arm. Weakening BEGIN IMMEDIATE
      to a deferred BEGIN, disabling the startup repair, or replacing the driver
      with a no-op each turn the corresponding test RED — the fixture cannot
      pass vacuously. Cross-process linearization is therefore asserted
      categorically: a change that cannot keep that fixture green is a
      violation, not a caveat.

      # multi-line options object. The evaluator greps line-oriented over a diff
      # (no multi-line / `s`-flag regex, no dataflow), so any grep either flags
      # every `withSession(` (false-positives) or demands the key on one physical
      # line (misses the multi-line form). A flaky check is worse than an honest

        Does every append carry an idempotency key, and does every external side
        effect run at most once across retries? A handler retried via
        withSession({operationId}) must re-emit the requested event as a no-op
        when the key matches. Flag an append with no idempotency key, a
        withSession retry path missing operationId, or an external mutation that
        can run twice on retry.
    summary: >
      Every append carries an idempotency key. The UNIQUE INDEX on
      idempotency_key collapses duplicates at the storage layer. Handler retries
      via withSession({operationId}) re-emit the requested event as a no-op when
      the key matches; the external side effect runs at most once across
      retries. INV-8 is the load-bearing prerequisite for INV-13's
      process-manager two-event split.

        Is each agent's authority bounded by the chokepoint that owns the

        launcher-owned: it is a per-harness capability that must be reported as
        prevention | detection | advisory | unavailable, and must never be
        inferred from the launcher's cwd or worktree ownership. Flag a posture
        asserted in prose but not enforced at a capability boundary, and flag
        any claim that a task-isolated agent CANNOT write outside its worktree

    summary: >
      Every agent declares one of three postures in agent spec YAML: read-only |
      task-isolated | shared-mutating. The MCP initialize handshake declares the
      runtime half. The capability resolver merges posture with handshake;
      mismatches resolve to the handshake (handshake-authoritative). What a
      posture makes unrepresentable-by-construction is bounded by the chokepoint
      that owns the resource: STATE authority in the dispatch/MCP handler (a
      read-only agent cannot invoke a mutating action), PROCESS LIFECYCLE and
      top-level worktree placement in the spawn-bounded launcher. SPATIAL write
      confinement is deliberately EXCLUDED from the by-construction claim: no
      component in the single-machine frame owns the kernel write path, and
      harness-created nested worktrees sit outside the launcher's reach, so
      filesystem confinement is a DECLARED per-harness capability carrying a
      posture of prevention | detection | advisory | unavailable — never
      inferred from launcher cwd/worktree ownership. Lifecycle ownership and
      spatial isolation are separate audit dimensions; absorbing spatial
      confinement into this invariant requires the space-moat fork (an upstream
      Bash-covering hook standard or a kernel sandbox), and asserting it before
      that lands is an overclaim, not an invariant.

    summary: >
      The next_actions field on ToolResult publishes runtime affordances — valid
      transitions perceivable to consuming agents. Agents read next_actions and
      dispatch the listed verbs; they do not poll. Autonomy is a property of
      state + topology (which determines next_actions), not of any handler's
      internal logic. Removing a verb from next_actions removes the agent's path
      to invoking it, but does not remove the underlying affordance — the
      topology still permits it.

      Exarchos is a single-machine event-sourced process manager with
      cooperative agents — concurrent, not distributed. No saga, no
      Scheduler-Agent-Supervisor, no 2PC, no leader election, no vector clocks,
      no BFT consensus, no distributed locks. Compensation is local rewind over
      the event log, not remote command dispatch. Liveness is event-emitted
      (INV-10), queryable via lifecycle verbs. Cooperation is by construction
      (INV-11 posture + INV-12 affordance). When a candidate design imports
      primitives from outside this frame, the frame rejects it.

    summary: >
      The MCP wire projection of the compiled contract is the invocation
      surface; the CLI is a CLIENT of that same contract, equal to the wire BY
      CONSTRUCTION rather than by hand-coordination — not a peer facade kept in
      step by fixtures. Behavior lives in the shared dispatch core; a client
      carries presentation only (argv parsing, exit codes, stdio framing, error
      rendering, carrier translation). Byte- and schema-equivalence across
      carriers (the parity harnesses plus each action's registered Zod
      outputSchema) is the WITNESS of that construction, never the invariant
      itself: a suite of green parity fixtures does not make two hand-written
      surfaces equal. The shipped `adapters/cli/cli.ts` meets this framing for
      dispatch ADDRESSING: every api-action call site addresses its action by
      contract ActionId through the generated client
      (`contract/cli/generated-client.ts`, a contract projection) which verifies
      the id against the compiled surface before dispatching, so an action the
      contract does not compile cannot be addressed and the adapter imports no
      runtime `dispatch` value; the Commander tree it keeps is hand-authored
      presentation. The DR-25 deviation that previously covered the adapter's
      hand-assembled direct dispatch path (`cli-direct-dispatch`) is RETIRED and
      CLI_CONTRACT_DEVIATIONS is empty; the census machinery stays armed, so any
      future direct route to the dispatch core must be a contract projection or
      record a new governed, owned, expiring deviation — an acknowledged,
      expiring debt AGAINST this invariant, never a weakening OF it.

    summary: >
      Authored content is emitted ONCE as a standard-conformant artifact
      wherever a standard converged — Agent Skills (SKILL.md), AGENTS.md, and
      MCP — and each harness reads it natively; the only residual per-harness
      variance is the tool prefix, carried by a bare logical name the agent
      resolves from its own tool list. Per-runtime fan-out is TECHNICAL DEBT,
      not the target architecture: a thin shim survives only where NO standard
      exists, and every residual shim carries an owner, the capability reason it
      exists, and a retirement condition. Conformance plus shim minimization —
      not render-parity across N runtime variants — is the metric, because a
      byte-perfect per-harness render proves the artifacts match, not that the
      guarantee holds. Source-of-truth edits go to content/; everything under
      rendered/** is generated build output and is never edited directly.
      Runtime-specific text is tokenized via {{TOKEN}} placeholders or guarded
      via <!-- requires:* --> blocks. INV-4 owns the *harness* axis; INV-6 owns
      the orthogonal *workload* axis (workflow types) and INV-16 the orthogonal
      *OS* axis — substrate guarantees hold across all three.

      of the canonical response contract — declared in the registry descriptor,
      enforced in the shared core, rendered through a presentation seam — never
      special-cased in one facade. This is downstream of the GOVERNING INV-2
      (the CLI is a client of the compiled contract, equivalence by construction
      — re-approved under DR-26, superseding the #1608 pending note) and of the

        Does every action declare (or inherit) a response-economy budget, with
        unbounded output gated behind an explicit schema-typed escape hatch
        (detail/limit/fields)? The mechanical backstops are the
        registry-enumeration budget snapshot test (pins every action's effective
        budget; an invalid budget fails the test) and the dispatch-core economy
        guard (caps only data, stamps _meta.truncated, fails open with
        _meta.economyDegraded), plus the economy-seam no-bypass gate
        (dispatch.economy-seam.test.ts — asserts, by source structure, that
        every result-producing branch of dispatch() and the withTelemetry seam
        route the raw handler payload through enforceResponseEconomy, so a new
        execution mode cannot silently ship an un-capped branch; this is the
        Axis-2 / enforcement-application backstop the coverage-axis snapshot
        tests do not provide). Flag any new action shipping unbounded output
        without a declared budget or a schema-typed escape hatch, and any
        capped/summary response shape absent from the action's registered
        outputSchema.


        **Vacuity is a violation, not a pass.** INV-17 names `outputSchema`
        totality as the precondition that makes facade equivalence hold by
        construction. A schema total *because it constrains nothing* is total
        over wrong shapes as well as right ones, so "schema-checked" degrades to
        a tautology. Treat a vacuous declaration at the same severity as a
        missing one.


        **Decide vacuity by reading the declaration, not its name.** Vacuous iff
        `data` is unconstrained, regardless of binding name or wrapper depth:
        (a) literal `EnvelopeSchema(z.unknown())`; (b) a *named* binding whose
        definition is that literal — `WorkflowUpdateOutputSchema` **is**
        `EnvelopeSchema(z.unknown())`; (c) a wrapper/intersection constraining
        only `_meta`/`_perf`/deprecation while `data` stays `z.unknown()` —
        `WorkflowTransitionOutputSchema`; (d) any `vacuityWaiver(...)` entry,
        which records vacuity *tolerated*, never *satisfied*.


        **Operable test: name one wrong response shape this schema rejects.** If
        you cannot, it is vacuous. A name, a wrapper, or a constrained `_meta`
        is presence; only a constrained `data` is substance. (An earlier
        revision of DR-4 classified two declarations as typed *because they had
        names*; measurement showed both vacuous.)


        Report each vacuous declaration by action + file:line. The live baseline
        is enumerated by
        `tools/conformance/src/output-schema-census.ts` — read
        it rather than quoting a count — and pinned shrink-only by the allowlist
        in `src/output-schema-vacuity-allowlist.ts`, whose
        key set is frozen in
        `tools/conformance/src/output-schema-seed-pin.ts`. A diff adding a
        vacuous declaration, or moving an allowlist entry sideways rather than
        off, is a violation.

# Exarchos Architectural Invariants

Machine-readable catalog of the architectural invariants that govern Exarchos design and review. The YAML frontmatter above is the **source of truth** for tooling — the `/ideate` command, the `check_invariant_conformance` gate, and the `vocabulary-lint` scanner all consume the same shape.

This file pairs with the prose reference content under [`invariants/references/`](invariants/references/). The frontmatter `summary` field is the short version; the linked reference files carry the full prose, severity guides, worked examples, and external grounding. (Prior to T-23 these references lived under the now-retired `design-invariants` skill; the skill's audit behavior is now performed by the `check_invariant_conformance` gate.)

## Schema

Each entry in `invariants:` carries:

| Field | Type | Required? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | yes | Stable identifier — `INV-1`..`INV-15`, sub-disciplines like `INV-5a`/`INV-5b`/`INV-5c`/`INV-5d`, plus cross-product entries (`basileus-boundary`). |
| `dimension` | string | yes | Short human-readable category name. |
| `axis` | enum | yes (v2) | One of `substrate` \| `authoring`. Substrate invariants govern runtime behavior; authoring invariants govern artifact content. Loader scope filter (`/ideate` Phase 0) honors this split. |
| `cost-of-load` | enum | yes | One of `always-load` \| `reference-only` \| `archivable`. Drives the `/ideate` Phase 0 split: only `axis: substrate ∧ cost-of-load: always-load` entries are surfaced by default (the `scope: 'core'` set); `reference-only` entries are loaded on-demand; `archivable` entries are kept for vocabulary-lint cross-references but never surfaced. |
| `applies-to` | string[] | yes | Surface areas (modules, file globs, capability domains) where the invariant is load-bearing. |
| `summary` | string | yes | One-to-two-sentence statement of the invariant. |
| `citations` | string[] | no (v2) | External research grounding — recommended ≥3 entries for substrate-axis invariants. Each entry is a free-form citation string (typically `Author, *Title* (Year): URL`). |
| `references` | string[] | yes | Pointers to internal source files where the invariant is detailed in prose. |

The catalog gates behind the `.exarchos.yml: invariants.devCatalog: enabled` flag (default disabled, no auto-detection). When disabled, the loader returns `[]` regardless of scope. See [`docs/guides/exarchos-yml-invariants.md`](../guides/exarchos-yml-invariants.md) for the consumer-facing reference.

## Vocabulary

The vocabulary-lint scanner (`src/architecture/vocabulary-lint.ts`, exposed via `npm run lint:invariants`) walks the live normative surfaces — `docs/architecture/`, `docs/guides/`, `content/`, and `commands/` — for tokens matching `/\b(INV-\d+[a-d]?|DIM-\d+)\b/` and cross-checks against the IDs declared here. Dated record trees under `docs/` (designs, plans, research, rca, contexts, followups, proposals) are intentionally out of scope so retired vocabulary (e.g. the `DIM-*` dimensions removed in #1477) does not fail the lint forever; the `DIM-\d+` shape is retained in the regex so a stray reference in a live surface still surfaces. Unknown references are findings; the vocabulary lint is enforcing (exits non-zero on findings).

## Consumers

- `/exarchos:ideate` — surfaces relevant invariants as Constraints during Phase 0 (before Phase 1), before the clarifying questions.
- `check_invariant_conformance` gate (`src/verbs/gates/check-invariant-conformance.ts`) — audits design proposals against INV-1..INV-15 (substrate runtime invariants). The audit prompt is catalog-generated (`src/architecture/audit-prompt.ts`). This gate replaced the retired `design-invariants` skill (T-23).
- `vocabulary-lint` — flags references to invariant IDs not registered here.
- Future: `#1275` MCP Resources — expose this catalog as `resources/exarchos-invariants` once Resources land.
